# Rainbow Driver

RainbowDriver is an attempt to implement the Selenium JSON Wire Protocol for
WinJS / Windows 8 applications (formerly known as Metro).

The project is very early stages, but we plan to grow fast.

Help is appreciated, specially with documentation. Reach us out in the issues or via email.

#Rainbow Driver Client [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rainbowdriver/rainbowdriver-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rainbowdriver/rainbowdriver-client)

This is the component that runs inside your WinJS app after instrumentation. It has something
similar to the __selenium atoms__ (i.e. click events) and communication with rainbowdriver-server.
